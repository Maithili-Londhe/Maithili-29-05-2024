Type-Casting : 
    In Java, type casting is a method or process that converts a data type 
      into another data type in both ways manually and automatically.
    The automatic conversion is done by the compiler and manual conversion 
      performed by the programmer.
      
  Defination-Convert a value from one data type to another data type is known as 
             type casting.
   
  Types of Type Casting-
      1)Implicit Conversion-Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called
                            Implicit Conversion.
           byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double  
           
      2)Explicit Conversion- Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called 
      						Explicit Conversion.
        double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
